## About Me:

I got into the world of programming by accident, but it turned out to be a happy accident for me. I worked as a QA Engineer and decided that i don't want to read someone's code, I want to create it myself. 

I am also studying at the university on the last year. I love to collect puzzles, draw and everything related to detectives. 

My positive qualities: perseverance, attentiveness, responsibility, sociability, stress tolerance, punctuality. 

My goal is to be a strong developer in order to become a teamlead and be able to travel. I dream of working in a friendly team with interesting tasks and cool oppotunities for future.
